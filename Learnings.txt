1. Difference between range and xrange:


->The advantage of the xrange type is that an xrange object will always take the same amount of memory, 
no matter the size of the range it represents. There are no consistent performance advantages.

range creates a list, so if you do range(1, 10000000) it creates a list in memory with 10000000 elements. xrange is a generator, so it evaluates lazily.

This brings you two advantages:

You can iterate longer lists without getting a stackoverflow error.
As it resolves each number lazily, if you skip the iteration early, you wont have the penalization of the creation of the whole list.

2. Used to cmp(temp1,temp2) , compare two elements(list, int, str etc..)

3. To combile all elements of a list temp2 use -> ''.join(temp2)
